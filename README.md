# MySharebotNg

This is my first approach to Git and project sharing.

This work for me!

Based on first Sharebot NG firmware https://github.com/Sharebot3D/Marlin

The original PSU was dead, I've changed it with a FTX PSU (from a dead 1U server ) I've implemented the PSU_CONTROL

I've added a filament runout sensor.

I'm trying to add a bltouch sensor.
